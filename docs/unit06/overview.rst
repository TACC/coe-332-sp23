Unit 6: Intro to Databases, Persistence, and Containerizing Redis
=================================================================

In this unit, we will implement a Redis database to store our data sets
such that they persist beyond the lifetime of our application containers.
We will also learn how to query our data from within a Python script, and
connect our containerized Flask API with a containerized Redis database.
